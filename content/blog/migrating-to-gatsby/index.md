# Why?

I can hear you already, "Didn't you **JUST** make your blog in Jekyll? Why are you switching?". Well, I realized that while Jekyll is nice and low-effort I actually wanted my blog to be cool. Gatsby has support for a ton of modern features which are harder to find in Jekyll. Gatsby uses React which makes for some nice practice. Even though I said I didn't want to code and just write content, I realized I was wrong and I actually like writing code :)

Gatsby still fills the other requirements I set like markdown content, easily deployable. It has the added benefit that it uses Javascript tooling which I am far more experienced with than Ruby tooling.

# Starting off

I started by picking out a [nice theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/renyuanz/leonids) and promptly started tearing it apart and putting different pieces in to create something custom. With React this was a lot easier for me than it was in Jekyll.
